                4. A brief document explaining how your app works and any optional enhancements you added.

    This is a note-taking web application with a functional implementation of the ability to add, edit, and delete notes. 
    Here's a summary of what my code does:

 -It maintains a list of notes in the notesArray array.

 -The addNote function is responsible for adding new notes to the array and updating the displayed list of notes with word validation up to 500 words only. 
  It clears the input field after adding a note.

 -The sortNote function sorts the notes in the array, clears the note list, and displays the sorted notes. 
  It also attaches event listeners for the "Edit" buttons, “Save” button after sorting.

 -The EventFuntion function handles the click events of the "Edit", "Save" and “Delete” buttons within each note. 
  It enables users to edit notes, save changes and delete the notes. 
  It also maintains the currentIndex, which is clicked by the user and set it equal to editIndex to keep track of which note is being edited.
  After the “Save” button is clicked, calling the sortNote function to make sure all notes displayed in alphabetical order. 

 -The code sets up an initial display of notes by calling sortNote after adding a click event listener to the "Add" button.
